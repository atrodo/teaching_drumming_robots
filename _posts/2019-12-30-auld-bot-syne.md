As 2019 closes, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on everything I've done
this year with Teaching Robots. The first commit I made was in late 2018, so
most of the development has been done this year. Looking back, I can see that
I've done a lot of coding and discovery this year.

In the past year, I accomplished a lot of things:
* Made around 100 commits
* Made about 15 blog posts
* Created a Neural Network from scratch
* Learned x86 SIMD/intrinsics in C
* Used SIMD to speed up my Neural Network code
* Generated very rudimentary drum beats with Neural Networks
* Implemented a genetic algorithm to create new Neural Network variants
* Figured out how to write fitness functions to test music
* Figured out how not to write [fitness functions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-08-30-fitness-your-veins %})
* Connected the Neural Network up to generate a sound file
* Learned a lot about what Neural Networks [can]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-06-06-against-bot-troubles %}) and [cannot do](2019-05-23-some-kind-robot %})
* Created an [IRC bot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-22-robotman %}) to aid in managing the various data types
* Made a [streaming process]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-06-25-robot-i-did-it-again %}) to reduce the feedback loop
* Discovered how DFT and FFT work, [in theory]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-12-16-seed-to-bot %}) and [in practice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-12-17-botting-dancing-unicorns %})

Not the least of all of this was the four month stint working on `FFT` and
Melody Extraction. A noticeable portion of those four months was just in the two
posts.

Looking through that list, even with the time spent working just one one
project, I feel good about what I've accomplished. I've done a lot this year,
and I am hoping that soon I'll be able to start creating something musical from
all of this work and start refining everything I've created so far.
